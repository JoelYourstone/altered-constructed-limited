# Altered TCG Summary

Altered is a trading card game (TCG) developed by Equinox Games. Each player builds a deck led by a Hero card, aligned with one of several factions. Players explore two Expeditions — one led by their Hero and one by a Companion — across regions to make them meet before the opponent’s do.

The deck-building rules depend on the format, but a standard constructed deck contains at least 39 cards and 1 Hero from a single faction. Gameplay is divided into phases (Morning, Noon, Afternoon, Dusk, Night). Cards are played from zones such as Hand, Deck, Mana Zone, and Reserve, and during Dusk players compare Expedition strength to progress toward victory.

Altered integrates physical and digital play. Each physical card features a unique QR code, which can be scanned to register ownership on a digital platform. This allows cards to be used both in-person and online without duplication or counterfeiting. Players can manage their collections digitally, build decks online, and play through Altered’s official online client, which synchronizes with verified card ownership.
