# Packlocked Format Summary

Packlocked is a custom hybrid format for Altered TCG that combines sealed and constructed play. Each player builds a standard-legal deck (at least 39 cards + 1 Hero from one faction), but only using cards from their own opened boosters.

## Rules Overview

- Each player maintains a personal card pool built from up to **36 booster packs**.
- Each set can contribute a **maximum of 12 boosters** to the pool.
- The pool may include fewer boosters initially; players can participate with smaller pools.
- Boosters are **physically opened** by each participant, and their cards are digitally owned.
- **No trades or purchases** of singles are allowed; decks are limited to personally owned cards.
- Decks must still follow **constructed rules** (e.g., copy limits, rarity restrictions).
- Over time, the pool will consist of cards from **up to three sets**. When a new set releases, the oldest set rotates out.
- Cards from rotated-out sets remain the player’s property for normal play but are excluded from Packlocked.
- **Sealed integration:** players can use sealed-event boosters to play sealed and then add those same packs to their Packlocked pool afterward, as long as they don’t exceed 36 boosters total.

## Purpose

Packlocked aims to reduce pay-to-win dynamics while maintaining deckbuilding creativity. It encourages skill, unique card pools, and a fairer meta without requiring continuous purchases. It merges the best aspects of sealed (creativity and randomness) and constructed (strategic consistency).

## Season and Rotation

- The format is organized into **seasons**, each defining the active sets and rotation policy.
- The website tracks current season rules, allowed sets, and player pools.
- Rotation replaces the oldest set with the newest when a new expansion releases.

## Online Integration

- Players register on the Packlocked website to log and view card pools.
- Pools are **semi-private**: only logged-in players can view others’ pools.
- Gameplay itself is not part of the format’s website; it only tracks ownership and eligibility.
